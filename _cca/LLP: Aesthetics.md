<p>We believe arts education is a powerful tool that helps students to become
positive thinkers and spirited citizens. Positive thinking and perseverance
are especially important during times of rapid change. As such, we design
our aesthetics program to develop students' heads, hearts, and hands.</p>
<p>With a variety of platforms, students learn to be critical and creative
thinkers. These skills are emphasized in three anchor curricula - Lower
Secondary Music, Lower Secondary Arts and the Performing Arts CCA groups.
When creating music, artwork or performances, students exercise creative
and critical thinking skills. Students are encouraged to be curious, to
think from diverse perspectives and to explore multiple possibilities to
develop their creative capacity. Students are also guided to weigh critically
which option would be the best. Through these platforms, students cultivate
the habits of thinking creatively and critically. The ability to see different
perspectives and think of alternatives helps a student become more optimistic
as they move through life.</p>

<p>To teach students to appreciate the arts is not an end in itself. One
of its goals is also to help students see the beauty in their surroundings,
leading to gratitude and joy in life. We also offer a stage for students
to show off their talents and develop their self-confidence and self-esteem.
For example - Interclass Dance Competition, Lunch Time Concerts, Mayflower
Got Talent, Visual Art Exhibitions and external leadership camps and workshops.
Another platform that encourages all students to participate in performing
arts performances is our Biennial Aesthetics Production. To a greater extent,
students apply their creative skills to design and implement their vision
into reality on stage. Through this platform, many students have become
more confident in public speaking and understand that deliberate effort
leads to positive results. These students enjoy the experience of succeeding
on stage.</p>
<p>At our school, the arts are not solely for personal interest and passion.
The students are encouraged to think about how they can use their artistic
talents to meet the needs of the wider community. By using the Design Thinking
framework, students learn to create with empathy and meet their intended
recipients' authentic needs.</p>
<p>At Mayflower Secondary School, we believe in providing a space for the
arts because we know that arts education builds individuals with a zest
for life.</p>

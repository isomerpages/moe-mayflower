Welcome to the Mayflower Humanities Department! Our department comprises of a team of qualified and dedicated teachers who are passionate about the study of humanities.

Our aim is to provide students with an **engaging and stimulating learning environment** where they can explore the diversity of human experience and gain a **deep understanding** of key concepts, issues, and themes in our world today. 

We recognize that **every student is unique** and thus believe in using a **variety of teaching methods that cater to diverse learning styles** to ensure that all students are able to develop their skills and achieve their full potential and be able to thrive in our fast-changing world. 

Our Humanities Department also prides itself on its inclusivity and commitment to fostering a **culture of respect, understanding, and tolerance**. We believe in providing a safe and nurturing environment where students feel empowered to express themselves freely and grow intellectually and personally.

> In a nutshell, we aim to put empower our students in the classroom by putting them in the driver’s seat.

Our lessons are designed to develop in our students the **dispositions needed to be an independent learner**. From peer to self-assessments and reflections, we nudge our students to evaluate and defend their perspectives and answers. 

With Blended Learning here to stay, our teachers have continued to **leverage on technology**. In order to keep up with the changes, special emphasis has always been placed on the professional development of our teachers. The Humanities teachers work together to design learning experiences tapping on the affordances of technology to promote self-regulated learning. Teachers attend workshops and share ways to differentiate learning in the classroom so that students can learn at their own pace.

At Mayflower, we also believe in creating opportunities for our students to further their **learning beyond the classroom**. We offer field trips, sessions with guest speakers, enrichment activities and exposure to competitions that complement the curriculum and provide students with practical experiences that enhance their learning.

At the end of the school experience at Mayflower, we hope to have imparted in our students the love and appreciation of the humanities. 

If you have any questions or would like to know more about our curriculum, please contact us. 


Notable Programmes &amp; Events
---------------------------
#### Investigative Projects
Inquiry based learning as the cornerstone, students of all levels embark on Geographical Investigations either conducted in school or outside school depending on the nature of the topic. Lower Secondary students also work on historical sources to make sense of the past and form interpretations and conclusions relating to Singapore history. In Social Studies classes, our Secondary 3 students and all NT students, embark on various projects to better understand current societal issues.

#### MOE Geography/History Challenge 
Every year, we send a team of students to participate in the Geography and History MOE Challenges. By doing so, we have given students to learn deep and go beyond the syllabus. These competitions have also been an excellent way to talent spot promising students who are offered to take the Talent Development Programme specifically meant for students keen to pursue these humanities subjects at the A level. 

#### PROVE IT! Competition
Selected lower secondary students take part in this inter-school challenge that examines their ability to evaluate for reliable information, an important life skill in these times.

The Mayflower Secondary Craft and Technology (C&amp;T) Department vision was crafted in 2019 to provide our C&amp;T educators with a focal point and a vision of the Mayflowerians that they will nurture through the C&amp;T subjects. In conjunction with MOE‚Äôs drive to develop 21st century citizens, this vision helps the department to align teaching and learning approaches to ensure that the desired outcomes of the C&amp;T syllabi are achieved. This vision also provides the foundation for our teachers‚Äô continual reflection and professional development, so as to strengthen the learning experiences for our students.

#### Learn for Life Programme

The yearly LFL-C&amp;T programme for the Secondary one cohort was designed to meet explorative learning needs in the 21st century world of Art, Design and Food cultures. The immersion programme is planned, designed and implemented by the C&amp;T teachers for immersing the students in meaningful and joyful learning.

To deepen the sense-making of Art, Design and Food Science learning, emerging technological learning tools are purposefully integrated into the LfL-C&amp;T programme so as to prepare them for the real world as well as nurture in them the disposition necessary to be lifelong learners.

#### Learning Journeys

The C&amp;T department advocates place-based pedagogy to support in-classroom approaches towards teaching and learning. So as to contextualise what is taught in the classroom to real world applications and experiences, students are regularly invited to partake in learning activities in museums, artists‚Äô studios and other industry affiliations. Students gain a deeper understanding of how the knowledge gleaned in the classroom is applicable and has positively impacted their community in the real world. Through their interaction with industry practitioners, students will also identify with specific dispositions, skills and attitudes that they need to emulate in order to further their endeavour in the different craft and technological disciplines.

#### Student-curated Exhibitions

Student-curated exhibitions have become a department trademark in recent years. We believe that these exhibitions provide opportunities for students to exercise their communication, discernment and organisational skills while they celebrate their learning progression and technical competencies with the school community and invited guests. These exhibitions are a testimony to the positive student outcomes that transpired from the department‚Äôs curriculum design and pedagogical approaches.

Happening in 2020

### Sec 2 Subject Allocation 2020

üí°How best can we enhance the understanding of elective subjects at Upper Secondary, bearing in mind the importance of students‚Äô interests and passions? How best to do this especially with constraints of the current safe distancing measures?üßê

Nothing beats hearing from the voices of ex and current learners! ü§∏‚Äç

Our department took a new approach to equip students and parents with a better understanding of our electives (Artüé®, Design &amp; Technologyüõ†, Nutrition and Food Scienceü•™ and Mobile Robotics ü§ñ) offered to our Secondary 2 students.

Mayflowerians can check out the publicity posters embedded with QR code linked to videos of current and ex-students sharing passionately about what they have enjoyed and learned from the subjects.  

In &nbsp;addition, our teachers shared what each elective can offer. To complement these efforts, parents will be engaged in a web conference to find out more about the electives.

In doing so, we hope to empower and arouse our learners' intrinsic motivation to seek out additional information so as to make an informed decision regarding their subject options. üéà

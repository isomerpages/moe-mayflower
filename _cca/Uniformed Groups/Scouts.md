Be Prepared
-----------

Scouts aims to develop the full physical, intellectual, emotional, social and spiritual capacities of our scouts so as to allow them to contribute to the development of a better world. We continuously challenge our scouts to attain the various proficiency badges so as to have the capability to ‘Be Prepared’ in all situations.

### The Mission of Scouting

The mission of Scouting is to contribute to the education of young people, through a value system based on the Scout Promise and Law, to help build a better world where people are self-fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive role in society. This is achieved by:

*   Involving them throughout their formative years in a non-formal educational process
*   Using a specific method that makes each individual the principal agent of his or her development as a self-reliant, supportive, responsible and committed person
*   Assisting them to establish a value system based upon spiritual, social and personal principles as expressed in the Promise and Law

### The Vision of Scouting

Better Scouting for more young People

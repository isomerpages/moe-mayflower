> Heart and Sweat Wins Championships

  

The Basketball CCA aims to

*   Increase student’s passion for the sport
*   Build strong friendships and understanding among teammates
*   Develop qualities of a sportsman: competitiveness, fairness, teamwork and humility.

  

At Mayflower Basketball, our primary objective is to inculcate values to develop our students to be determined, resilient and fair individual. They are being put through rigorous physical training as well as a myriad of drills to develop their individual skills. Team drills and friendly matches then come into play when the students are being prepared for their season. By the time the students graduate, they would have developed strong friendships with their peers due to the team work needed for the game.

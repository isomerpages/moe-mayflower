<blockquote>
<p>Never let good enough be enough.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In our CCA, Netball, we want every individual to achieve their fullest
potential in their physical, mental and social skills. Our guiding principles
of perseverance and hard work and our emphasis on team effort, team building
and team bonding make up the dynamics of our team. Our CCA leaders have
always taken on the role of organisers, planning our Secondary 4 graduation
party, day camp and CCA Open house as part of their leadership training.
This also helps to strengthen the bonds amongst our CCA members. Even though
we did not have a chance to experience these programmes in 2020, we have
full faith that our leaders will emerge stronger in 2021!</p>
<p>Our Netball team is currently training under Coach Sue who started coaching
us at the end of 2017. Coach Sue comes to us with many years of coaching
experience and we have seen great improvements both individually and as
a team. Coach Sue may be strict at times but never fails to show care and
concern during training. She puts in maximum effort in teaching us and
never fails to correct us whenever we make mistakes. She got creative during
the HBL period, designing activities and games to engage our players.</p>
<p>We also want to take this opportunity to show our appreciation to our
celebrity star coach, Ms Paige Chua who occasionally drops by whenever
she can despite her busy schedule. She is a role model for our students,
having graduated from Mayflower as Netball Captain and Vice-President of
Student Councillor, and an active alumni.</p>
<p><strong>Training sessions:</strong>&nbsp;Tuesdays and Thursdays, 3 pm
to 5 pm</p>

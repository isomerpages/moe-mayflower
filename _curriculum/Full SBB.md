Mayflower Secondary is one of the 28 secondary schools piloting aspects of Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) since 2020.

### Purpose of Full SBB

With Full SBB, we are moving towards one secondary education, with many subject bands, to better meet our students’ learning needs, without labels. This is part of the broader shift in our education system to recognise the strengths and interests of our children, to help them build their confidence and develop an intrinsic motivation to learn for life in them.

### Full SBB Pilot in Mayflower Secondary School


As part of the pilot, our school has implemented these aspects of FSBB:
  

#### 1\. Offering of Humanities subjects at a more demanding level

**This is applicable to students who are in Secondary 2 Normal.**

*   Eligibility criteria is based on their Sec 1 Overall results and subject teacher’s feedback.
*   Students who meet the eligibility criteria will receive a Letter of Offer.
*   Consideration factors to offer the Humanities at a more demanding level includes their strength and interest in the subject as well as an appropriate overall academic load for the child.

  

#### 2\. Organising Lower Secondary classes in new ways

*   Each form classes may comprise students from the Express, Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) streams.
*   This common learning experience creates a valuable setting for students to work together, build meaningful friendships, and appreciate different perspectives with students from diverse background and abilities which will benefit them in life. It can also help reduce the inadvertent labelling associated with streaming.
*   The students will take a set of subjects at a common level together for lower secondary Art, Character &amp; Citizenship Education, Design &amp; Technology, Food &amp; Consumer Education, Music, and Physical Education.

* For all other subjects, they will be grouped in classes according to the level at which they offer each subject, i.e. Express, N(A) or N(T).

Cyber Wellness
==============
Understanding Cyber Wellness
----------------------------

Our students today belong to a linkster generation who are constantly connected. The open nature of the internet poses a danger to our students as it can expose them to undesirable content which may corrupt their value systems, and to unnecessary hurts.

Cyber Wellness is important as it looks into the positive well-being of students as they navigate cyberspace.

### What is Cyber Wellness?

Cyber Wellness refers to the positive well-being of internet users. It involves an understanding of the norms of appropriate, responsible behaviour with regard to technology use as well as knowledge, skills, values and attitudes on how to protect oneself and other internet users in the cyber world. It looks into the positive physical and psychosocial well-being of students in their use of mobile and internet technologies. Students should also be a positive peer influence by harnessing technology for collaboration, learning and productivity, as well as advocating positive use of technology for the good of the community.

### Goals of Cyber Wellness

The goal of the Cyber Wellness curriculum is to equip students with life-long social-emotional competencies and sound values so that they can become safe, respectful and responsible users of Information and Communication Technology (ICT).

### Key Messages

The key messages to students are to:

*   Embrace ICT yet maintain a balanced lifestyle between the physical and the cyber world
*   Harness the power of ICT for positive purposes
*   Maintain a positive presence in cyberspace
*   Be a safe and responsible user of ICT

_The linkster generation, also known as The Facebook Generation, are members of the population who were born after 1995, according to Johnson & Johnson (2010). They are the so-called Linkster Generation because no other generation has ever been so linked to each other and to the world through technology._

MOE's Cyber Wellness Framework
------------------------------

MOE uses the CW framework to develop the child’s instinct to protect and empower him to take responsibility for his own well-being in cyberspace. The three principles, ‘Respect for Self and Others', ‘Safe and Responsible Use’ and ‘Positive Peer Influence’ when adhered to will anchor a child’s well-being in cyberspace as he will then be able to make careful and well-considered decisions.

The school adopts MOE’s Cyber Wellness Framework in educating our students on Cyber Wellness. This framework focuses on three key processes: Sense, Think and Act.

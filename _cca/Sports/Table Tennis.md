Table Tennis
============

### Championships are won at practice.

The Table Tennis CCA aims to:

*   improve table tennis skills
*   develop an ever-lasting love for the sport
*   inculcate values that will go beyond just the sporting arena

Table Tennis – (noun) a game that takes place on a hard table divided by a net.

The MFSS Table Tennis Team, however, is united by each individual’s love for this sport. Through rigorous training sessions and bonding opportunities, our members have developed a greater appreciation and commitment to our team. As a clear result of the team’s determination and passion, the MF table tennis team has once again achieved exceptional results in this year’s South Zone Championships with three divisions being placed among the Top Four Positions.

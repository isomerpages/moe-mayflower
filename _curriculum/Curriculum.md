The Mayflower Academic Programme
--------------------------------

The Mayflower \[MF\] curriculum is designed to prepare our students for the future. The recent paradigm shift in education has meant that the distinct roles of teachers and learners have become increasingly blurred, and education is no longer defined in terms of what a teacher will teach but rather in terms of what a student will be able to demonstrate. Consequently, we have been refining the way in which the MF curriculum is structured and technology is being harnessed to maximize learning.

Another key focus of ours has been to help our students ‘lift the lid’; eradicate limiting beliefs in the face of challenges and aim high and believe in one’s potential and ability to succeed with fortitude.

### Learner-Centred Pedagogies

At Mayflower, we constantly strive to bring about a student–centred curriculum in a nurturing environment. Across departments, learning experiences have been changing to promote active learning in the classroom. Problem-solving and inquiry-based approaches are used pervasively to promote the exploratory nature in learning. Subjects are also taught in a way that allows students to appreciate its relevance in real world contexts.

### Assessment for Learning

As students become active learners, assessment for learning has naturally become an integral part of our curriculum to ensure clarity in learning intention for both teachers and students. This is because in order to be responsible for what a student learns, we must first understand WHAT a student knows before new learning begins and HOW best to build on what each student already knows. Lessons are thus purposefully crafted to promote more self-regulated learning.

### Customisation

At Mayflower, we recognize that every student is unique and so conscious effort is made to customize pedagogy and programmes so that no student is left behind. Our curriculum plans reflect the student segmentation and the spiral development of competencies and skills from Lower Secondary to Upper Secondary. To cater to students’ needs, interests and intrinsic motivation to learning, Advanced Elective Modules, Elective Modules and Life Skills workshops are conducted.

To help students who are struggling with subjects, the school also conducts targeted remediation, consultations and programmes to help these students catch up with their peers. Students with special needs are also supported by a team of teachers to help them cope better in school.

Our Applied Learning Programme \[ALP\] is focused on Effective Communication

In line with preparing our students for the future, we have a comprehensive programme to develop Mayflowerians into effective communicators. Broad based programmes [Tier 1] targeted at the entire school population are planned and run by the English Language and Mother Tongue departments throughout the year. Specialised programmes are spiralled to Tier 2 level whereby selected students with talents and who show interest are trained and coached for greater exposure such as competitions.

Full Subject Based Banding \[FSBB\]
-----------------------------------

Mayflower is one of the schools that have embarked on FSBB. Starting this year, our Secondary One students were placed in mixed classrooms; students taking subjects at the various streams \[Express/NA/NT\] shared the same form class. These students were taught common curriculum subjects together \[PE, Art, Design & Technology, Food & Nutrition and Citizenship and Character Education\] while they were still banded into different classes for other subjects like English, Mother Tongue, Math, Science and the Humanities depending on the level at which they were offering these subjects. This has allowed for better integration among the students and a higher level of motivation as students were not labelled according to a stream but instead were recognized for their strengths in the different subjects. Having gone through the FSBB for one year, our school is better equipped to handle the changes that will come with assessment in the near future as streams are phased out completely.

National Digital Literacy Programme
===================================

Overview
--------

The National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) was launched in March 2020 to make digital learning inclusive by equipping students with digital literacies to be future-ready.

As part of NDLP, MOE announced in 2020 that every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed personal learning device (PLD) by end-2021.

The aims of NDLP are to:  

*   Support the Development of Digital Literacies
*   Support self-directed and collaborative learning
*   Enhance Teaching and Learning

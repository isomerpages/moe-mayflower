<h3>About the Choir</h3>
<p>The Mayflower Secondary School Choir is a group of vibrant, young people
who share a common love in singing, living by the vision of a family that
sings together, firm yet fun.</p>
<p>In 2022, after the Covid-19 Pandemic, the choir held it is first public
concert entitled Song of Joy Song of Hope.</p>
<p>The Choir was awarded Certificates of Distinction in the 2015, 2017,2019
and 2023 SYF Arts Presentation.</p>
<p>In 2014 and 2017, the Choir also received Distinctions in the Associated
Board of the Royal Schools of Music (ABRSM) Choral Singing (intermediate)
examinations.</p>
<p>The Choir performed at the Esplanade Concert Hall in the Limelight Series
at the invitation of Esplanade in 2016 and in 2019. The choir was invited
by Odyssey Dance Theatre in 2017 to be the chorus for their Dance Fiesta
opening production, involving many international artists and multi-disciplinary
artistry.</p>
<p>The choir believes in giving back to society. In 2019, the choir performed
in “Bloom”, a concert by Singapore Chinese Girl’s School, in aid of VIVA
Foundation for Children with Cancer. The choir has also volunteered their
time in Willing Hearts to prepare meals for the charity’s beneficiaries.</p>
<p>Singing a wide variety of choral music, the MFSS Choir aspires to engage
the community through singing, to grow in the pursuit of choral excellence,
and to deepen the bonds shared through music-making.</p>
<p>The Choir is under the choral leadership of Conductor Mr. Toh Ban Sheng
and Assistant Conductor Ethel Poh.</p>

<p><strong>Our choir's music to the world in light of COVID-19</strong>
</p>
<p>In light of COVID-19, livelihoods of many are affected, be it as patients
and family members, healthcare workers overwhelmed by alarming numbers
in the hospitals, contact tracing officials, governments, freelancers,
businesses, people who need to cross borders daily to make a living, and
the list goes on.</p>
<p>In these turbulent times, we’d like to let you know, in our own little
way, we are all in this together – you do not walk alone.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewing Our Alumni</strong>
</p>
<p>Hear the stories from some of our recently graduated choristers from the
class of 2019, who are studying in Eunoia Junior College, Raffles Institution
(Junior College), and Saint Andrew's Junior College as JC1 students in
2020. Whilst their paths now diverge, what they have gone through in the
4 years together has shaped them into who they are today.</p>

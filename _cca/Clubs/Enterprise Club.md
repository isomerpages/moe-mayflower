&gt; To think and act like entrepreneurs

**The Enterprise Club CCA aims to**

*   Inculcate the values and skills to be an entrepreneur
*   Develop qualities to be creative and visionary students who are able to plan ahead

The Mayflower Enterprise Club has a well-integrated co-curricular programme that promotes life skills, character building, and leadership qualities. At the end of four years, we hope to see our students as creative individuals who are well-equipped entrepreneurs of good character.

Every student will be given an opportunity to experience a planning process. This student-directed initiative will allow students to be more involved in the brainstorming, planning, experimenting and execution process to give them a flavour on how to organise an event.

Students learn to manage funds wisely through events or selling of their own products during CCA duty. In Enterprise Club, we believe that our students will demonstrate creativity and initiative in every aspect and without fear to seize opportunities in future.

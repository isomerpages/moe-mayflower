### About the Choir

The Mayflower Secondary School Choir is a group of vibrant, young people who share a common love in singing, living by the vision of a family that sings together, firm yet fun. The Choir was awarded Certificates of Distinction in the 2015, 2017 and 2019 SYF Arts Presentation. In 2014 and 2017, the Choir also received Distinctions in the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music (ABRSM) Choral Singing (intermediate) examinations.

The Choir performed at the Esplanade Concert Hall in the Limelight Series at the invitation of Esplanade in 2016 and in 2019. The Choir took the opportunity to collaborate with other art forms such as dance and visual art, premiering its first commissioned choral work composed by Professor Bernard Tan. In further collaboration, the choir was invited by Odyssey Dance Theatre in 2017 to be the chorus for their Dance Fiesta opening production, involving many international artists and multi-disciplinary artistry.

Beyond Singapore, the Choir embarked on an overseas choral trip to Hong Kong in 2016, having a public performance at Tai Po Civic Centre and school choral exchanges with reputable school choirs of the region. More than just receiving performance opportunities, the choir also believes in giving back to society. In 2019, the choir performed in “Bloom”, a concert by Singapore Chinese Girl’s School, in aid of VIVA Foundation for Children with Cancer. The choir has also volunteered their time in Willing Hearts to prepare meals for the charity’s beneficiaries.

Singing a wide variety of choral music, the MFSS Choir aspires to have more opportunities to engage the community through singing, to grow in the pursuit of choral excellence, and to deepen the bonds shared through music-making. The Choir is under the choral leadership of Conductor Advisor Mr Toh Ban Sheng and Conductor Mr Xie Zhizhong.

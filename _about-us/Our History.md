The original Mayflower Secondary School building was built at a cost of $5.46 million on a 2.7 hectares plot of land along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 in the then new Ang Mo Kio Satellite Town. The school started in 1981 with 408 students and became one of the more popular neighbourhood schools in this area.

Mr Selamat Alvie designed the original school logo, with the letters MSS enclosed by a set of upward pointing and downward pointing arrow-heads. Mrs Yang Peng Hwa introduced the school motto, “Magnanimity and Modesty” which was incorporated into the logo.

Mr Wan Hussin wrote the lyrics of the School Song while Mr John De Souza composed the music, arranged by Mr Ho Eng Kheng.

In September 1981, Mr Ibrahim Othman took over from Mr Wan Hussin, who was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health and Culture.

The School was officially opened on 15 July 1983 by the then Member of Parliament of Kebun Baru, Mr Lim Boon Heng.

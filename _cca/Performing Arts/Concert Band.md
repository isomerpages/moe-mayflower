### History

Founded in 1981, the Mayflower Secondary School Concert Band aspires to nurture talents, build friendship through music and create music that reaches the listener's heart.

We enrich our members' musical experiences through local and overseas exchange programmes, and through performance opportunities at school as well as public events. Our members also contribute actively through various community outreach programmes and service-learning activities.

We have had the privilege to perform at the Istana, the Istana Park, Merlion Park, etc., and also get to showcase our members’ musical skills at numerous local public concerts. Our repertoire includes pieces from the standard symphonic pieces to pop music pieces from all over the world, and members are often exposed to challenging pieces that require strong teamwork and determination to deliver.

As our students undergo the process of rehearsing in the band, either for foot drills or music drills, the organised routines allow them to learn the values of discipline, teamwork, responsibility and commitment. As they participate in competitions, students also learn to celebrate their achievements while maintaining humility or even to accept defeat in good grace. These are valuable experiences that our members will gain in the four or five years they are with us.

We take pride in developing potential young musicians. Many of our members have graduated and gone on to involve themselves in the bands in the junior colleges, other institutes of higher learning, as well as the Singapore Wind Symphony. Some have even continued to pursue professional art or music career.

Infocomm Club
=============

**Empowering Youth in Technology**

The Infocomm Club aims to

*   Deepen students’ passion for IT
*   Equip students with IT skills and knowledge and broaden their perspectives on IT
*   Develop students into responsible and highly efficient members in AVA
*   Forge strong friendships and a sense of camaraderie among members

In Infocomm Club, we equip students with IT skills and knowledge and broaden their perspectives on IT by exposing them to a wide variety of topics such as photography, videography, programming and game development. Students are also trained in AVA to be responsible and highly efficient members capable of handling challenging tasks to ensure the smooth running of school events.

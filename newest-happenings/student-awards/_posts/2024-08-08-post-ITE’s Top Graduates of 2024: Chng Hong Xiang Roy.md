<p>Chng Hong Xiang Roy was conferred the Tay Eng Soon (TES) Gold Medal, at
the ITE Graduation Ceremony last week. The TES Gold Medal is awarded to
an outstanding graduate from each ITE College, who has achieved excellent
course performance, participated actively in co-curricular activities and
contributed to the well-being and development of his or her college.</p>
<p>Roy is currently pursuing a Diploma in Infocomm &amp; MEdia Engineering
at Nanyang Polytechnic. We believe his achievements will be an inspiration
to our juniors in our school.</p>

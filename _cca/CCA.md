The Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) in Mayflower Secondary School form an integral part of a student’s life.

Under the 4 domains – Performing Arts, Sports, Uniformed Groups, and Clubs, we focus on 2 main areas as part of our CCA programme in MF – character development and student leadership.

In character development we look at how we can instil values in our students through the myriad of CCA experiences – CCA exhibition, Singapore Youth Festival, National School Games, handover ceremony, competitions, parades, Open House etc. We focus on 4 learning outcomes – building resilience, self-motivation, aspiring towards one’s best self and emotion regulation in shaping our students’ character.

For student leadership, we provide opportunities and platforms to train our CCA leaders as they apply the skills learned. The students hone their leadership qualities through their CCAs.

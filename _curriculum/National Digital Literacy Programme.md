National Digital Literacy Programme
===================================

Overview
--------

The National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) was launched in March 2020 to make digital learning inclusive by equipping students with digital literacies to be future-ready.

As part of NDLP, MOE announced in 2020 that every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed personal learning device (PLD) by end-2021.

The aims of NDLP are to:  

*   Support the Development of Digital Literacies
*   Support self-directed and collaborative learning
*   Enhance Teaching and Learning

### How Will Your Child Be Using Their PLDs?

They will use their PLDs to access platforms such as the Student Learning Space (SLS), Google Workspace, Slido, Mentimeter, Kahoot, Nearpod, Padlet, to:

**\[In school\]**  
* To support their learning experiences
*   To review their learning and close learning gaps
*   To collaborate with their peers and teachers

**\[Beyond school\]**  
* To continue to learn during home-based learning (HBL)
*   To explore topics of their personal interests and preferences
*   To learn and make use of digital tools such as calendaring and note-taking applications to enhance personal productivity and develop life skills

### Digital Applications for Students

As part of the NDLP, schools will progressively roll out ICT applications that are vital to students’ educational journey. These applications will form an integral part of the applications installed in the PLDs:

### Cyber Wellness Education

MOE has enhanced Character and Citizenship Education (CCE 2021) to significantly incorporate cyber wellness to educate students on the demands of NDLP.

Topics covered in the Cyber Wellness lessons include:

*   Cyber Use
*   Cyber Identity
*   Cyber Relationships
*   Cyber Citizenship
*   Cyber Ethics

  
As parents, you can also play a part by

*   modelling good digital habits for your child,
*   knowing your child well, and have conversations with your child about safe and responsible use of technology,
*   setting ground rules for internet use,
*   navigating the internet together with your child to understand their usage.

##### Teaching Group Allocation Mapper for Full SBB Schools

With Full Subject Based Banding (Full SBB), Mayflower Secondary School implemented social mixing for all Secondary 1 classes, where each form class contained students from all three streams. The students attend lessons in teaching groups (TG) e.g. Express Science, Normal (Academic) English, etc. As students in each form class read different streams for different subjects, and with further banded classes, the school management has greater difficulty in homing into the correct group of subject teachers of a particular student to coordinate any interventions, as compared to past years without the mixed stream form class implementation.

An innovative in-house Excel programme was created to consolidate data from various School Cockpit reports, and then churn out user-friendly data for teachers, school management, and students. This saves a lot of time and energy for teachers to be better channeled to other areas such as student well-being and teaching and learning.

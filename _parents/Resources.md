<h2>Healthy Meals in Schools and at Home</h2>
<p>Dear parents,</p>
<p>Childhood and adolescent years are crucial to set the foundation for healthy
growth. Eating a nutritionally balanced diet supports optimal growth and
development. By encouraging healthy eating habits now, you can give your
child the best opportunity to grow into a healthy adult.</p>
<p>HPB has developed a Parents’ Booklet to encourage parents to nurture healthy
eating habits at home. Together with the Healthy Meals in Schools Programme,
we aim to promote the consumption of healthy meals with a balanced mix
of the four different food groups – brown rice, whole grain noodles and
wholemeal bread; fruit and vegetables as well as meat and alternatives,
both in school and at home. The Booklet is available on our school website
for your use.</p>
<p>Thank you for partnering with us.</p>
<p>Warm regards,

Our department comprises of a team of qualified and dedicated teachers who are passionate about the study of humanities.</p><p>Our aim is to provide students with an <strong>engaging and stimulating learning environment</strong> where they can explore the diversity of human experience and gain a <strong>deep understanding</strong> of key concepts, issues, and themes in our world today.</p><p>We recognize that <strong>every student is unique</strong> and thus believe in using a <strong>variety of teaching methods that cater to diverse learning styles</strong> to ensure that all students are able to develop their skills and achieve their full potential and be able to thrive in our fast-changing world.</p><p>Our Humanities Department also prides itself on its inclusivity and commitment to fostering a <strong>culture of respect, understanding, and tolerance</strong>. We believe in providing a safe and nurturing environment where students feel empowered to express themselves freely and grow intellectually and personally.</p><p>&gt; In a nutshell, we aim to put empower our students in the classroom by putting them in the driver’s seat.</p><p>Our lessons are designed to develop in our students the <strong>dispositions needed to be an independent learner</strong>. From peer to self-assessments and reflections, we nudge our students to evaluate and defend their perspectives and answers.</p><p>With Blended Learning here to stay, our teachers have continued to <strong>leverage on technology</strong>. In order to keep up with the changes, special emphasis has always been placed on the professional development of our teachers. The Humanities teachers work together to design learning experiences tapping on the affordances of technology to promote self-regulated learning. Teachers attend workshops and share ways to differentiate learning in the classroom so that students can learn at their own pace.</p><p>At Mayflower, we also believe in creating opportunities for our students to further their <strong>learning beyond the classroom</strong>. We offer field trips, sessions with guest speakers, enrichment activities and exposure to competitions that complement the curriculum and provide students with practical experiences that enhance their learning.</p><p>At the end of the school experience at Mayflower, we hope to have imparted in our students the love and appreciation of the humanities.</p><p>If you have any questions or would like to know more about our curriculum, please contact us.</p><h2>Notable Programmes &amp; Events</h2><h4>Investigative Projects</h4><p>With inquiry-based learning as the cornerstone, students of all levels embark on Geographical Investigations. Lower Secondary students also work on historical sources to make sense of the past and form interpretations and conclusions relating to Singapore's history. In Social Studies classes, our Secondary 3 students and all NT students, embark on various projects to better understand current societal issues.</p><h4>MOE Geography/History Challenge</h4><p>Every year, we send a team of students to participate in the Geography and History MOE Challenges. By doing so, our students are given the opportunity to learn deeply and go beyond the syllabus. These competitions have also been an excellent way to talent-spot promising students. These students are offered to join the Talent Development Programme specifically meant for students keen to pursue these humanities subjects at the A level.</p><h4>PROVE IT! Competition</h4><p>Selected lower secondary students take part in this inter-school challenge that examines their ability to evaluate for reliable information, an important life skill in these times.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/science1.jpg"></div><p><strong>Let’s NOT get left behind as we travel the virtual world!<br>Put on your VR Goggles and scan the QR code below to experience it yourself.</strong></p><h2>Photo</h2><p><strong>Active Learners</strong></p><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="450" width="600" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQyXMfG5juOyJlOxRPoaEsSHQw4KMsU_mLV2bRgAgCoXqmGZ54f5K9XFfmCbky5T2R3XmURvZKvSLSw/embed?start=1&amp;loop=1&amp;delayms=3000"></iframe></div><p><strong>External competitions have been challenging and particularly</strong></p><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="450" width="600" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vT9IvgGucY7kY0p6UUCf9ZDeL1-5hrwSigSoeJlLTieCWudJwLx_R_OeV6ujqjQdb6nKuQahGqXQymQ/embed?start=1&amp;loop=1&amp;delayms=3000"></iframe></div><p><strong>Learning Outdoors with fieldwork</strong></p><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="450" width="600" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSjba9ag3LPaJWw4QigvLuV9TNU5yW2G_LvaWswFiWTsNgPmiVIXTWDWQeYZ688Ee0GGnndn0daUfkN/embed?start=1&amp;loop=1&amp;delayms=3000"></iframe></div><p><strong>Opportunities to learn from the Experts!</strong></p><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="450" width="600" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTxNhAaYg56u-Yprhiny3lpkfHcH9jNbgxJsKBV4F49XGhAaLW2orCgVojCW9JDFMhsfoejtvsYYGy7/embed?start=1&amp;loop=1&amp;delayms=3000"></iframe></div><h2>Videos</h2><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Geography</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>History</p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/o3a1fkLsNS4" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Take a flight over a Volcano!</a> <br>&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/ELQh3z4KrXk" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Hike through the Rainforest</a> <br>&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/PFqv_QKO574" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Stroll along the slums</a></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><a href="https://youtu.be/m7h4XuvLrmg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Trench Warfare</a> <br><a href="https://youtu.be/5xKaXPrfAMs" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Air Raid Tunnels WW2</a> <br><a href="https://youtu.be/Hgp6ZH-by-E" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Atomic Bombing</a></p></td></tr></tbody></table><h4>YouTube</h4><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="450" width="600" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mln87VqWOTQ"></iframe></div><p></p>

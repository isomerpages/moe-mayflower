Literary &amp; Orators Club
=======================
**To be inspired by, and to inspire with...WORDS**

The LnO CCA aims to&nbsp;

● Develop reading, speaking and writing in English

● Cultivate a love for literacy and life

Words are powerful--they influence thoughts, feelings, and action. By reading and listening to the words of others, we broaden our perspectives. By speaking and writing, we educate, entertain and encourage. Some of our platforms are debates, public speaking, and writing exhibitions. In essence, the world is our stage. We live and breathe the power of words, allowing ourselves to be inspired by, and to inspire with words.&nbsp;

**Every LNO member will be trained in Scrabble, Digital Print Media and Toastmasters.**

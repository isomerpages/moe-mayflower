Mother Tongue
=============

Department Vision
-----------------

Effective Global Communicators rooted in Values with a Love for the Languages and Cultures

Department Mission
------------------

To nurture **Active Learners, Proficient Users** anchored in values who embrace their ethnic identities.  
To develop **Forward Thinkers** with a global outlook and appreciation for unity in diversity

  

It is important for students to not only learn the Mother Tongue Languages but also learn to appreciate the beauty of the languages and cultures behind them. To engage our learners, our teachers take life-long learning seriously and infuse ICT tools in the process of teaching and learning. MT teachers hope to infuse ICT into Assessment for Learning (AfL) and encourage students to take ownership of their learning.

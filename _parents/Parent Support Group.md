<p>Retired Principal, Mrs Jenny Yeo, shares how problems at home can affect
a child’s learning in school.</p>
<p>Recently, one of my friends said, “More and more of my pupils are acting
up and not doing well in school because of family problems. Are parents
aware of this? Do they know that their relationship as a couple affects
their child?”</p>
<p>Researchers at the Center on the Developing Child, Harvard University
shared &nbsp;that “when (the) home is not stable…executive function skills
may be impaired, or may not develop at all, limiting a child’s success
in elementary school and later life.”</p>

<p><strong><em>Summary</em></strong>
</p>
<p>The article was written by retired Principal Mrs Jenny Yeo about how problems

home environment and the poor relationship of parents at home may limit
a child's success in school and later life.</p>
<h2>Healthy Meals in Schools and at Home</h2>
<p>Dear parents,</p>
<p>Childhood and adolescent years are crucial to set the foundation for healthy
growth. Eating a nutritionally balanced diet supports optimal growth and
development. By encouraging healthy eating habits now, you can give your
child the best opportunity to grow into a healthy adult.</p>
<p>HPB has developed a Parents’ Booklet to encourage parents to nurture healthy
eating habits at home. Together with the Healthy Meals in Schools Programme,
we aim to promote the consumption of healthy meals with a balanced mix
of the four different food groups – brown rice, whole grain noodles and
wholemeal bread; fruit and vegetables as well as meat and alternatives,
both in school and at home. The Booklet is available on our school website
for your use.</p>
<p>Thank you for partnering with us.</p>
<p>Warm regards,

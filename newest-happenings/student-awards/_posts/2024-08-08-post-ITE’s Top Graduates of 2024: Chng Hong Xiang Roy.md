<p>Chng Hong Xiang Roy was conferred the <strong>Tay Eng Soon (TES) Gold Medal</strong>,
at the ITE Graduation Ceremony last week. The TES Gold Medal is awarded
to an outstanding graduate from each ITE College, who has achieved excellent
course performance, participated actively in co-curricular activities and
contributed to the well-being and development of his or her college.</p>
<p>Roy is currently pursuing a Diploma in Infocomm &amp; Media Engineering
at Nanyang Polytechnic. We believe his achievements will be an inspiration
to our juniors in our school.</p>
<h4>Programming is Life</h4>
<p>Roy found an interest in computing, when he was in secondary school. Keen
to pursue this field further, he enrolled in the Higher Nitec in IT Applications
Development. At ITE, Roy actively seized opportunities to hone his programming
skills. He put himself to the test by participating in the WorldSkills
Singapore 2023 competition, where he competed in the area of Mobile Applications
and Development. His strong sense of initiative impressed his internship
supervisors, who entrusted him to lead the development of a new application.</p>
<p>Roy sees technology as an enabler, and wants to use his knowledge to empower
others. Besides helping his peers in their studies, he has been creating
programming-related tutorials on YouTube and writing coding articles for
a charity organisation. Roy aspires to build a technology start-up that
could make a positive impact on society in the future.</p>
<h4>Challenged to Excel</h4>
<p>“My lecturers at ITE were incredibly supportive and I am very grateful
for that. They encouraged me to participate in various competitions and
leadership CCAs to further develop myself. My journey in the WorldSkills
Singapore 2023 competition was particularly tough and required a lot of
self-learning, but it helped to build my mental toughness. I have learned
that I can conquer any challenge, so long as I give my best efforts and
never give up.”</p>
<h4>After ITE</h4>
<p>Roy is pursuing a Diploma in Infocomm &amp; Media Engineering at Nanyang
Polytechnic. He hopes to take a degree in Computer Science or Engineering,
after attaining his Diploma.</p>

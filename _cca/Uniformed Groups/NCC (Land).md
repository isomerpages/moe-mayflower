NCC (Land)
==========

**To Serve with Pride and Dedication**

  

The NCC CCA aims to  

*   Enable NCC Cadet to be “Cadet Strong”
*   Foster a resilient mind, fit body and committed heart
*   Grow as a self-motivated leader

Singapore citizens and permanent residents typically join the NCC as a Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) around the same time they enrol in Secondary School at the age of 13. They then stay for a term of 4 to 5 years. Cadets who wish to stay on in the Corps after completing their secondary education may apply to undergo a 2-week Cadet Officer Course (COC). Cadets who graduate from the Course are then appointed as Cadet Officers (C/Offr).

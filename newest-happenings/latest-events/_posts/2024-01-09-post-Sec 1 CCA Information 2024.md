Here are some steps to help you decide:</p><p><strong>Explore Your Interests:</strong> Consider what you enjoy doing. Are you into sports, arts, music, uniform groups or community service? Start with what interests you the most.</p><p><strong>Consider Your Strengths:</strong> Think about your strengths and skills. If you're athletic, sports might be a good fit. If you're creative, maybe arts or music could be enjoyable.</p><p><strong>Personal Growth:</strong> Consider how the CCA can help you grow personally. Some activities may enhance leadership skills, teamwork, or creativity, which can be beneficial in the long run.</p><p><strong>Try Out Different Activities:</strong> Attend trial sessions or open houses for various CCAs. This allows you to get a feel for the activity and see if it aligns with your interests and preferences.</p><p><strong>Seek Advice:</strong> Talk to seniors or teachers who oversee CCAs. They might offer valuable insights into the different options and help you make an informed decision.</p><p><strong>Do not miss out on the opportunity to check out the 18 CCAs we have in Mayflower Secondary. You can check for the respective CCA Trial and Audition dates in the attachment appended below.</strong></p><p>Ultimately, choose something you're passionate about and enjoy. Remember, it's okay to try out a few activities before settling on one. Keep an open mind, and don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone to discover new interests!</p><p><a href="/files/Sec_1_CCA_Talk_Parents_2024_Slides.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Sec 1 CCA Talk Parents 2024 Slides</a></p><p><a href="/files/2024_Sec_1_CCA_Audition_and_Time_Annex_A.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2024 Sec 1 CCA Audition/Try Out Dates and Time</a></p><p><a href="/files/2024_Sec_1_CCA_Audition_and_Time_Annex_B.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2024 Sec 1 CCA Audition/Try Out Dates and Time (Month view)</a></p>

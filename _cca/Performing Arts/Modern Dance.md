============

**Dance to Express**

  

### The Modern Dance CCA aims to

*   Nurture students to become physically and verbally effective communicators of the art form;
*   Develop creative thinkers through choreography

The Modern Dance Club specialises in contemporary dance which incorporates elements from many styles of dance such as classical, ballet and jazz. During the CCA training, we focus on mastering strong and controlled legwork of ballet, floor work, fall and recovery and other techniques.

### PE Department

The Mayflower PE programme allows students to experience lessons through a variety of activities. They are exposed to 6 Sports namely Frisbee, Floorball, Badminton in Lower Secondary; and Volleyball, Netball and Softball in Upper Secondary.

Also as part of the Outdoor Education module, students get to learn various skills such as navigation, outdoor cooking and shelter building. At Secondary Two level, our students will a go through a 4D3N Cohort Camp at the MOE-Outdoor Adventure Centre and in Secondary Three, a 5D4N MOE-OBS programme.

There are a range of topics pertaining to fitness and nutrition that students learn about for Physical Health and Fitness. They are also equipped with basic first aid knowledge as well as being assessed on the NAPFA (for Sec 2 and 4/5s) and alternative fitness tests (for Sec 1 and 3s).

For mass participation, there is usually the annual Mayflower Cross Country race and Sports Carnival enabling staff and students to come together for a time of bonding through fun and games.

### Music Department

Our 2 year music programme provides every Mayflowerian a meaningful Dance and Musical experience. At the beginning of the year, the students go through an exciting 5 week hip-hop and lyrical jazz dance module. Their learning culminates in an inter-class dance competition, aimed at developing in them confidence at performances, building class spirit and a strong sense of rhythmic pulse.

Through performance experiences with musical instruments such as the ukulele, keyboard and virtual instruments using Garage Band, Mayflowerians are engaged in decision-making during the process of performing, creating and listening to music.

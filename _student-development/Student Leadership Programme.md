Student Leadership Programme
============================
Vision
------

Caring and Supportive Culture where Peers Strengthen One Another

![](/images/leadership.png)

In Mayflower, Student Leadership Programmes are being used as a platform to develop the Generous Spirit among our Mayflowerians. This is done by deepening the inculcation of the value of respect by&nbsp;**celebrating differences and contributing to society with empathy**.

Student Leadership programmes are divided into level-wide, school-wide and targeted student leadership training programmes. Level-wide Student Leadership programmes focus on developing the Mayflowerian’s team-building skills through programmes such as the Sec 1 Orientation and Sec 2 Cohort Camp. In the effort to strengthen their communication and collaboration skills when working in teams, the programme also focuses on equipping our students with 4 social skills:

*   Disagreeing Appropriately
*   Negotiating with Others
*   Offering Help
*   Organizing task and time

The school-wide leadership programmes – Student Council Presidential Election and Student Leaders Dialogue are also added platforms for Mayflowerians to put what they have learnt into practice at a higher level as the programmes also give them a glimpse of what is it like to be a Concerned, Informed and Participative member of the community.

To create a positive student learning experience, Mayflowerians are provided with 7 different choices of Student Leadership experience. Students have a say as to which Student Leadership group they would like to be part of, based on their interest and their preference of how they would like to contribute to the school community. Each group of student leaders has its own area to look into.

Guided by the Student Leadership Vision,&nbsp;**“Caring and Supportive Culture where Peers Strengthen One Another”**, here in Mayflower Secondary School, we adopted the Kouzes and Posner Leadership framework. We focused on not only challenging the students to develop their leadership skills but also to build on the value of empathy in their service as Student Councillors, CCA Leaders, Peer Support Leaders, Class Leaders, Community Champions, Cyber-wellness Ambassadors and Arts Ambassadors. Equipped with the knowledge to use the&nbsp;**Design Thinking Model**, our student leaders are always reminded about the importance to practise empathy in designing the respective projects. These projects serve not only as training platforms but also provide them with opportunities to contribute back to the community.

Check out our Student Councillor Instagram page ([@mfssslb](https://www.instagram.com/mfssslb/)) to find out the different activities and projects our Student Councillors are involved in!

We recently modified our curriculum purposefully to maximize opportunities for our students to harness their 21CC skills to be future-ready in fun, engaging and meaningful ways! (Check out the reflections of our student leaders below)

Apart from the effective use of ICT, we also use Art, Experiential Pedagogy and thematic approaches and to engage our students. For example, while doing a module on mentoring, our CCA Leaders and Student Councillor Excos did interviews in Orchard Road and later filmed a video to showcase what they had learned about mentoring. Such authentic settings have made all the difference. Fun themes are also common. A little movie magic was added to our Sec 2 Student Councillor Overseas trips when they were designed based on Star Wars and Harry Potter themes in 2018 and 2019 respectively.

Our leadership training sessions continued even with the stringent safety measures put in place during this pandemic period. Using various modes of ICT, we continued to engage our student leaders in conversation so that learning continues.

Teachers-in-charge

All of this would not have been possible without a team of dedicated teachers who are committed to ignite and promote the joy of learning through our student leaders training programmes.

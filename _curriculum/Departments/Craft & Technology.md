Craft & Technology
==================
![](/images/ct1.jpg)

The Mayflower Secondary Craft and Technology (C&T) Department vision was crafted in 2019 to provide our C&T educators with a focal point and a vision of the Mayflowerians that they will nurture through the C&T subjects. In conjunction with MOE’s drive to develop 21st century citizens, this vision helps the department to align teaching and learning approaches to ensure that the desired outcomes of the C&T syllabi are achieved. This vision also provides the foundation for our teachers’ continual reflection and professional development, so as to strengthen the learning experiences for our students.

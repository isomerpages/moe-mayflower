**_Excitement. Exploration. Experience. Excellence._**  

---------------------------------------------------------

The Science Department aims to provide students with a holistic understanding of the world around them through an inquiry-based approach in the teaching and learning of Science, enabling them to see the relevance of Science to their daily lives, the society and the environment. 

The focus of the curriculum is to inculcate the spirit of scientific inquiry and nurturing our students to be the inquirer through the 5E Instructional model – Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate and Evaluate.

The department hopes to inspire every Mayflowerian to develop a learning experience of the Sciences beyond the classroom and enhance their depth of learning in the various domains of Science.

2020 Teaching and Learning Strategies
-------------------------------------

Science has taken on an even more crucial role in formulating our students’ understanding of the world. Authentic learning becomes more critical as we engage our students in the Joy of Learning and explore digital platforms to allow students to embark on self-directed learning and discovery. 

  

Through the infusion of ICT tools (e.g. Loom, Kami, Mail merge, etc), teachers were able to enhance their teaching and learning processes to better support students' learning needs. With the rollout of MOE’s National Digital Literacy Programme, the Science Department is excited to be at the forefront of digital literacy in education  

  

As a department initiative, Secondary 1 students are introduced to specially crafted lessons aimed to deliver the Joy of Learning into each topic. The aim is to inject authenticity in the learning process to allow students to learn beyond the classroom and textbooks.  

  

Our department’s teachers are also encouraged to share how Assessment for Learning strategies are incorporated in their lessons, especially during Home-based learning. This is to provide timely feedback for our students to address learning gaps and to allow them to “feed forward”. Using the Assessment for Learning Framework by Dylan Williams, teachers are equipped with the knowledge to put into practice throughout the year.

### About the Choir

The Mayflower Secondary School Choir is a group of vibrant, young people who share a common love in singing, living by the vision of a family that sings together, firm yet fun. 

In 2022, after the Covid-19 Pandemic, the choir held it is first public concert entitled Song of Joy Song of Hope.

The Choir was awarded Certificates of Distinction in the 2015, 2017,2019 and 2023 SYF Arts Presentation. 

In 2014 and 2017, the Choir also received Distinctions in the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music (ABRSM) Choral Singing (intermediate) examinations.

The Choir performed at the Esplanade Concert Hall in the Limelight Series at the invitation of Esplanade in 2016 and in 2019. The choir was invited by Odyssey Dance Theatre in 2017 to be the chorus for their Dance Fiesta opening production, involving many international artists and multi-disciplinary artistry. 

The choir believes in giving back to society. In 2019, the choir performed in “Bloom”, a concert by Singapore Chinese Girl’s School, in aid of VIVA Foundation for Children with Cancer. The choir has also volunteered their time in Willing Hearts to prepare meals for the charity’s beneficiaries.

Singing a wide variety of choral music, the MFSS Choir aspires to engage the community through singing, to grow in the pursuit of choral excellence, and to deepen the bonds shared through music-making. 

The Choir is under the choral leadership of Conductor Mr. Toh Ban Sheng and Assistant Conductor Ethel Poh.

**Our choir's music to the world in light of COVID-19**

In light of COVID-19, livelihoods of many are affected, be it as patients and family members, healthcare workers overwhelmed by alarming numbers in the hospitals, contact tracing officials, governments, freelancers, businesses, people who need to cross borders daily to make a living, and the list goes on.

In these turbulent times, we’d like to let you know, in our own little way, we are all in this together – you do not walk alone.

**Interviewing Our Alumni**

Hear the stories from some of our recently graduated choristers from the class of 2019, who are studying in Eunoia Junior College, Raffles Institution (Junior College), and Saint Andrew's Junior College as JC1 students in 2020. Whilst their paths now diverge, what they have gone through in the 4 years together has shaped them into who they are today.

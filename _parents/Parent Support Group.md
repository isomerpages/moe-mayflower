When Family problems affect Children in School
----------------------------------------------

Retired Principal, Mrs Jenny Yeo, shares how problems at home can affect a child’s learning in school.

Recently, one of my friends said, “More and more of my pupils are acting up and not doing well in school because of family problems. Are parents aware of this? Do they know that their relationship as a couple affects their child?”

Researchers at the Center on the Developing Child, Harvard University shared  that “when (the) home is not stable…executive function skills may be impaired, or may not develop at all, limiting a child’s success in elementary school and later life.”

_**Summary**_  

The article was written by retired Principal Mrs Jenny Yeo about how problems at home can affect a child's learning in school. It examines how the unstable home environment and the poor relationship of parents at home may limit a child's success in school and later life.

Healthy Meals in Schools and at Home
------------------------------------

Dear parents,

Childhood and adolescent years are crucial to set the foundation for healthy growth. Eating a nutritionally balanced diet supports optimal growth and development. By encouraging healthy eating habits now, you can give your child the best opportunity to grow into a healthy adult.

HPB has developed a Parents’ Booklet to encourage parents to nurture healthy eating habits at home. Together with the Healthy Meals in Schools Programme, we aim to promote the consumption of healthy meals with a balanced mix of the four different food groups – brown rice, whole grain noodles and wholemeal bread; fruit and vegetables as well as meat and alternatives, both in school and at home. The Booklet is available on our school website for your use.

Thank you for partnering with us.

Warm regards,  
Eric Wong  
HOD/PE&CCA

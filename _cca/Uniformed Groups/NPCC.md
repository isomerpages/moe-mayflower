&gt; D.A.R.E. (Discipline, Achieve, Resilience, Excellence)

The NPCC aims to

* Develop our members into active citizens and community leaders
* Work in partnership with the Singapore Police Force to fight crime and keep Singapore safe

  

In 1959, during the explosive period of Singapore's history, our society was fraught with problems of law and order. There was high tension and mounting hatred between the community and the Police Force. Youths were the main targets as riots and unlawful activities slowly took a stronghold of our society. Actions needed to be taken immediately to rout potential safety and security threats that were impacting the community. Police Cadet Corps (PCC, now known as NPCC) was set up with the aim to break the barrier between the people and the Police Force and to instill a greater sense of discipline in youth and a sense of civic responsibility in them, thereby developing their moral character. The first PCC unit started only with 30 cadets and a single teacher officer - Mr. Victor Seah.

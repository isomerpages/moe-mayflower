<div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:50%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/ct1.jpg"></div><p>The Mayflower Secondary Craft and Technology (C&amp;T) Department vision was crafted in 2019 to provide our C&amp;T educators with a focal point and a vision of the Mayflowerians that they will nurture through the C&amp;T subjects. In conjunction with MOE’s drive to develop 21st century citizens, this vision helps the department to align teaching and learning approaches to ensure that the desired outcomes of the C&amp;T syllabi are achieved. This vision also provides the foundation for our teachers’ continual reflection and professional development, so as to strengthen the learning experiences for our students.</p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Staff</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Designation</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Unit</p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mrs Angie Lee</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>HOD Craft &amp; Tech</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Nutrition &amp; Food Science</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mdm Suhaila Bakar</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>HOD CCE</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Design &amp; Technology</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mr Tan Kok Meng</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Senior Teacher</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Design &amp; Technology</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mr Marcus Ho</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Teacher</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Art</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mdm Noor Ezan Bte Khatib</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Teacher</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Art</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mdm Nurulhuda Binte Mustafa</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Teacher</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Art</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mr Tan Wee Tiong</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Asst Year Head</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Design &amp; Technology</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mdm Liu Xuefang</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Teacher</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Design &amp; Technology</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Ms Azmira Bte Zailan</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Teacher</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Nutrition &amp; Food Science</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mdm Sharon Goh</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Teacher</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Nutrition &amp; Food Science</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mr Hussen</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Technical Support Officer</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Design &amp; Technology</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mdm Chuo Chung Mee (Amy)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Operations Support Officer</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Nutrition &amp; Food Science</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Our Learning Outcomes</h3><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Art Unit</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>D&amp;T Unit</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>NFS Unit</p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Confident, self-directed visual learners who communicate effectively through meaning-making</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Innovative learners with a designerly disposition</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Discerning &amp; resourceful consumers</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Our Learning Domains</h3><hr><p><strong>Learn for Life Programme</strong></p><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="450" width="600" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vS5b1B6_qu2haVUhL1L43KHYd4kKeCcpPWw3ISLABJlceDPZBfMoPNnFL-hQZSajgnoxUUX9av1wLPv/embed?start=1&amp;loop=1&amp;delayms=3000"></iframe></div><p><strong>Learning Journey</strong></p><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="450" width="600" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRsZq1oYi4tCiqWP-xcFf5jrb0B7V9HIR70Kx_O4aQzPFsY1iHmIIJtyEo58dcuqwpLZyGufobiLr2z/embed?start=1&amp;loop=1&amp;delayms=3000"></iframe></div><p><strong>Student-curated Exhibitions</strong></p><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="450" width="600" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSH6b8qydmI6FOGtL1hQk8VIQCAg7R2mCF6a_mxzISAtRzbbNtfyLZPJll0C7qAC1sJatkvKwq_mGQu/embed?start=1&amp;loop=1&amp;delayms=3000"></iframe></div><h4>Learn for Life Programme</h4><p>The yearly LFL-C&amp;T programme for the Secondary one cohort was designed to meet explorative learning needs in the 21st century world of Art, Design and Food cultures. The immersion programme is planned, designed and implemented by the C&amp;T teachers for immersing the students in meaningful and joyful learning.</p><p>To deepen the sense-making of Art, Design and Food Science learning, emerging technological learning tools are purposefully integrated into the LfL-C&amp;T programme so as to prepare them for the real world as well as nurture in them the disposition necessary to be lifelong learners.</p><h4>Learning Journeys</h4><p>The C&amp;T department advocates place-based pedagogy to support in-classroom approaches towards teaching and learning. So as to contextualise what is taught in the classroom to real world applications and experiences, students are regularly invited to partake in learning activities in museums, artists’ studios and other industry affiliations. Students gain a deeper understanding of how the knowledge gleaned in the classroom is applicable and has positively impacted their community in the real world. Through their interaction with industry practitioners, students will also identify with specific dispositions, skills and attitudes that they need to emulate in order to further their endeavour in the different craft and technological disciplines.</p><h4>Student-curated Exhibitions</h4><p>Student-curated exhibitions have become a department trademark in recent years. We believe that these exhibitions provide opportunities for students to exercise their communication, discernment and organisational skills while they celebrate their learning progression and technical competencies with the school community and invited guests. These exhibitions are a testimony to the positive student outcomes that transpired from the department’s curriculum design and pedagogical approaches.</p><h2>Posters</h2><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="450" width="600" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRIG1SbmYTUI-rWtB7zey8cFfoB3XFfYFWF0owRbA601eQJTMgbR7HXu1uc_CI0AmH2KFPzRoMnm2xN/embed?start=1&amp;loop=1&amp;delayms=3000"></iframe></div><p></p>

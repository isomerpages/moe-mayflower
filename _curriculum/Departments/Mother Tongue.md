Mother Tongue
=============

Department Vision
-----------------

Effective Global Communicators rooted in Values with a Love for the Languages and Cultures

Department Mission
------------------

To nurture&nbsp;**Active Learners, Proficient Users**&nbsp;anchored in values who embrace their ethnic identities.  
To develop&nbsp;**Forward Thinkers**&nbsp;with a global outlook and appreciation for unity in diversity

  

It is important for students to not only learn the Mother Tongue Languages but also learn to appreciate the beauty of the languages and cultures behind them. To engage our learners, our teachers take life-long learning seriously and infuse ICT tools in the process of teaching and learning. MT teachers hope to infuse ICT into Assessment for Learning (AfL) and encourage students to take ownership of their learning.

Blended Learning
----------------

We believe in students co-creating learning experiences in class with teachers. Blended learning integrates the use of digital media with classroom activities and gives students more flexibility to customize for themselves more self-regulated and holistic learning experience.

During the alternate weeks of Home-based Learning (HBL), MTL teachers explored the blended learning approach to help students move seamlessly from learning online to face-to-face lessons. In the process, teachers used ICT platforms such as Google Classroom, Classkick and Pear Deck to monitor students’ work, give feedback and promote student engagement online and in class.

For the May/June holidays, the “MFSS Bingo Challenge” was introduced to students as an attempt to infuse fun elements with homework. There were 5 themes for the challenge, namely “Keeping in Touch with MT”, “Saving the Environment”, “Stay Healthy”, “Learn New Skills” and “Family Time”. By completing these challenges, students’ spirits remain positive, and their holidays are a fulfilling one despite not being able to go out.

Professional Development of Teachers
------------------------------------

Understanding that there is an increasing need to learn about online engagement of students, MTL teachers embarked on a journey to upgrade their ICT and AfL skills. An example will be the S1 Cluster course on “Practical Ideas to Teach CL to the Digital Generation” conducted online by Taiwanese Professor Dr Lien Yujien via Google Meet. Through the course coordinated by Lead Teacher Mdm Wang Xueping, the S1 Cluster Secondary School teachers upgraded their ICT skills by experimenting with different ICT tools together.

Throughout HBL, the teachers familiarised themselves with conducting lessons and attending courses online. The department TTT also shifted online and teachers took turns to share about their HBL journey. Using Google Meet, these sharings were recorded for professional development purposes and teachers could also view the recordings anytime to learn from their colleagues.

Signature Programmes / Enrichment Programmes
--------------------------------------------

### CNY Concert

In keeping with the MF tradition, CNY was celebrated with senior citizens from Asian Women’s Welfare Association (AWWA). They were invited to our annual concert and showered with “Hampers of Love. The school came together to prepare these hampers, filled with food and household items. While they were here, the senior citizens were taken care of by our Enterprise Club and the Girl Guides.

### ALP Tier 2 Programmes \[Chinese Language\]

This year, Sec 1 &amp; 2 HCL students attended the training for recital skills for a total of 6 sessions. They learnt important skills such as voice projection, using expressive emotions, and body language for text recital. Two of our teams and two students in the Individual category received the Silver Award in the 3rd Text Recital Competition.

To strengthen students’ critical thinking skills and develop their interest in debate, our students trained to participate in the National Secondary Schools Bilingual Debate Competition 2020. In the process, the learnt to critically craft their own arguments detect loopholes in their opponents’ arguments.

### Broad-based ALP \[Malay Langaugae\]

In July and August 2020, Sec 3 Express and NA Malay students took part in a 7 weeks Malay Debate Workshop organised by the Speaking Factory. This culminated in an intense Inter-Class competition. Among the many oratorical skills they picked up, students also were trained to think quickly on their feet!

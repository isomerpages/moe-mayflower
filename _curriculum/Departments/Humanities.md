Unprecedented times has called for unprecedented changes. Our education landscape is undergoing a massive transformation accelerated by the Covid pandemic. The new normal is anything but normal as we strive to prepare our students for a global, digital, information economy. The skills and knowledge that our students need as they compete for jobs with peers from around the world, have risen to the highest levels in history.

So in a nutshell,&nbsp;**the Mayflower Humanities Department is putting the student in the driver’s seat.**

We are constantly trying out new ways to prepare our students for life and not just to excel in the examinations. We aim to promote&nbsp;**DEEPER LEARNING**, the&nbsp;**_buzz phrase_**&nbsp;in our department. This entails not just mastery of core academic content but also, instilling in our students critical thinking &amp; problem solving skills, collaborative and communication skills as well as the right mindset to take on&nbsp;**_self-directed learning._**

Besides, sharing the success criteria with our students, we are exploring ways to&nbsp;**_deepen metacognition_**&nbsp;in a concerted effort to promote independent learning. From peer assessments to voting for the best work, we push our students to evaluate and defend their perspectives and answers.

With&nbsp;**_Blended Learning_**&nbsp;here to stay, our teachers continued to leverage on technology. While not unique to the humanities discipline, inquiry remains our main approach as we delve into investigative projects that promote the co-construction of knowledge with our students. By exposing our students to social issues that confound humankind, we hope they’d be better prepared to navigate their way in this&nbsp;**_VUCA_**&nbsp;world.

Special emphasis has always been placed on the professional development of our teachers. This year was no exception. The Humanities teachers worked as a team to learn a plethora of IT platforms to maximize learning during the Circuit Breaker period. Beyond that, the department also focused on&nbsp;**_Solo Taxonomy and Differentiated Instruction_**, to equip ourselves to be able to create more platforms for students of different learning styles to progress at their own pace.

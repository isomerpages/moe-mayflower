Mayflower Secondary is one of the 28 secondary schools selected by the Ministry of Education to start piloting aspects of Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) from 2020 onwards.

Purpose of Full SBB
----

With Full SBB, we are moving towards one secondary education, with many subject bands, to better meet our students’ learning needs, without labels. This is part of the broader shift in our education system to recognise the strengths and interests of our children, to help them build their confidence and develop an intrinsic motivation to learn for life in them.

Full SBB Pilot in Mayflower Secondary School
--------------------------------------------

As part of the pilot, our school has implemented the following:  
  

**1\. OFFERING OF HUMANITIES SUBJECTS AT A MORE DEMANDING LEVEL FROM 2020**

**This is applicable to students who are in Secondary 2 Normal from 2020.**

*   Eligibility criteria is based on their Sec 1 Overall results and subject teacher’s feedback
*   Students who meet the eligibility criteria will receive a Letter of Offer
*   Consideration factors to offer the Humanities at a more demanding level includes their strength and interest in the subject as well as an appropriate overall academic load for the child.

  

**2\. ORGANISING SECONDARY 1 FORM CLASSES IN NEW WAYS FROM 2021**

**This is applicable to Secondary 1 students entering our school from 2021.**

*   Each form classes may comprise students from the Express, Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) streams.
*   This common learning experience creates a valuable setting for students to work together, build meaningful friendships, and appreciate different perspectives with students from diverse background and abilities which will benefit them in life. It can also help reduce the inadvertent labelling associated with streaming.
*   The students will take a set of subjects at a common level together for lower secondary Art, Character & Citizenship Education, Design & Technology, Food & Consumer Education, Music, and Physical Education.
*   For all other subjects, they will be grouped in classes according to the level at which they offer each subject, i.e. Express, N(A) or N(T).

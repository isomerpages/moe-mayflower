Mayflower Secondary School organized a unique event on 7 August to encourage kindness and positive behavior among its students. At the heart of this event were the "Good Conduct Cards" awarded to students who consistently demonstrated commendable behavior. These cards could be exchanged for delicious food vouchers. 

The event featured a wide variety of delicious food options. Students participated enthusiastically. Some expressed regret for not having accumulated enough “Good Conduct Cards” to sample all the delectable treats.

During a school assembly, the discipline master encouraged students without enough points to exchange for food vouchers to strive harder next semester. This subtly instilled a goal for improvement in students’ mind. The event enhanced students' autonomy and their sense of showing kindness.

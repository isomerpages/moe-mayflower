&gt; Practice like you have never won. Dance like you have never lost

The Chinese Dance Club aims to:

*   Develop students' talent, passion, and appreciation of dance through Arts Experience, Arts Exposure, and Arts Excursion.
*   Showcase their talent and hone their dance skills through collaborative learning strategies.
*   Contribute to the community through their skills, talents, and knowledge.
*   Develop socio-emotional skills and leadership in students.

This year, we developed our Curriculum such that our regular training includes the following:

### Warm-up

Perform full-body warm-up led by 2 students on duty. Students on duty leading warm-up can lead either the standard routine or choose an alternative warm-up that still warms up the whole body and takes about the same duration. Buddies to look out for each other and give feedback during the warm-up and after.

### Technique

*   Build foundational techniques of Chinese Dance.
*   Execute movements and techniques with proper body alignment, good posture and engagement of core muscles
*   Buddies to look out for each other and give feedback during the exercises and after.

### Choreography

*   Discuss the cultural context and historical background of Chinese Dance.
*   Work collaboratively to create movements to portray a range of themes.
*   Rehearse choreography, which includes ideas and movements contributed by students.
*   Buddies to look out for each other and give feedback where possible.
*   Improve with feedback from teachers and peers.

### Cool-down and Reflection

*   Students on duty leading cool-down stretches can lead either the standard routine or choose an alternative that still stretches the whole body and takes about the same duration. Buddies to look out for each other and give feedback during the cool-down session and after.
*   Students use ICT to complete their Dance Diary entry where they reflect on their learning and allow teachers to understand how to support their growth.

In 2020, we took part in performances such as our annual CCA Showcase, Chinese New Year Concert and Chingay. Although COVID-19 postponed many of our performances, we have continued to prepare for upcoming performances such as our school’s Biennial Production, Adam’s Family. Indeed, COVID-19 did not stop us from training. As a CCA, we did at-home practices including yoga, and met online with various instructors to dance from the safety of our homes. Regardless of circumstances, Mayflower Chinese Dance stays united as a dance family, and members ceaselessly encourage one another to grow.

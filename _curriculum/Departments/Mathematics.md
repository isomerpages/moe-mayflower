### Demo App: GeoGebra

Moving towards self-directed learning, the Mathematics department greatly harness the use of technology and the affordances of smartphones to engage our students with a more interactive and self-paced way of learning. One of the applications used is GeoGebra. Below is a sample demonstration for students to discover the relations between trigonometric ratios of a general angle.

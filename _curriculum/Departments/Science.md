**_Excitement. Exploration. Experience. Excellence._**  

---------------------------------------------------------

The Science Department aims to provide students with a holistic understanding of the world around them through an inquiry-based approach in the teaching and learning of Science, enabling them to see the relevance of Science to their daily lives, the society and the environment. 

The focus of the curriculum is to inculcate the spirit of scientific inquiry and nurturing our students to be the inquirer through the 5E Instructional model – Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate and Evaluate.

The department hopes to inspire every Mayflowerian to develop a learning experience of the Sciences beyond the classroom and enhance their depth of learning in the various domains of Science.

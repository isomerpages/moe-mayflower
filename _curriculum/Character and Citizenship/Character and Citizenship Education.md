Character and Citizenship Education
===================================

About CCE
---------

Character Citizenship Education aims to inculcate values and competencies in our students so that they grow to be Mayflowerians who are reflective thinkers and active contributors of society. Our team of teachers design the main CCE curriculum by adopting a future-oriented focus where life experiences and contemporary issues form the contexts for learning. There is an increased level of student involvement in the co-design of these learning experiences as it encourages them to take on a more participative role and empowers them in their learning.

Students learn the values of responsibility, respect, integrity, care and harmony through different modes of engagement ranging from discussions, peer sharings, planning and enacting Values-in-Action projects and other learning experiences. Some of the signature learning experiences are captured in the table below.

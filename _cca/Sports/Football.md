&gt; Hard Work Beats Talent

The Football CCA aims to

*   Use football as a tool to fulfil the mighty potential of our players, both in thought and deed.
*   Build character through training sessions, where players work on individual and tactical discipline, selflessness in action, punctuality and most importantly, sportsmanship

Following the layering of astroturf for the school field, Mayflower Secondary is proud to announce the opening of the Football CCA for the 'C' Division in 2014. We have gone from strength to strength with currently 53 active members in our Football Team with virtually everyone having various opportunities to represent the school in external competitions.

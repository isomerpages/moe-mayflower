## Outstanding Innovator Award 2021: Mr Gabriel Cheow
<blockquote>This award recognises individuals who have been key influencers of innovation in their workplaces or beyond.</blockquote>

As a person who believes in maximising Teaching and Learning time (or contact time with students) and minimising menial administrative tasks via automated means, Mr Gabriel Cheow is always on the lookout to improve work processes in the workplace over the years, be it in the committee (Exams, SDT or ICT / Knowledge Management) or in the department (Mathematics). It was over many key contributions he has made in these aspects that has inspired colleagues around him in the committees and department to venture into said innovative thoughts. 

One key characteristic that makes Mr Cheow an Outstanding Innovator is the scalability of his innovations that can be scaled up to serve the whole school and beyond. A quintessential scale-up innovation would be the [ICT Teaching Tools Guide Google Site](https://sites.google.com/moe.edu.sg/ictguide/home) for all MOE Teachers during [the first full HBL in 2020](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/education/schools-to-shift-to-full-home-based-learning-from-april-8), where Mr Cheow initiated and collaborated with teachers islandwide to curate and organise ICT and EdTech tips for their colleagues in their schools. This is a scale-up from an earlier Google Site he created for the Math Department – MFSS Math Portal.

##### Teaching Group Allocation Mapper for Full SBB Schools

With Full Subject Based Banding (Full SBB), Mayflower Secondary School implemented social mixing for all Secondary 1 classes, where each form class contained students from all three streams. The students attend lessons in teaching groups (TG) e.g. Express Science, Normal (Academic) English, etc. As students in each form class read different streams for different subjects, and with further banded classes, the school management has greater difficulty in homing into the correct group of subject teachers of a particular student to coordinate any interventions, as compared to past years without the mixed stream form class implementation.

An innovative in-house Excel programme was created to consolidate data from various School Cockpit reports, and then churn out user-friendly data for teachers, school management, and students. This saves a lot of time and energy for teachers to be better channeled to other areas such as student well-being and teaching and learning.

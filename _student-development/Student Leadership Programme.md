In Mayflower, Student Leadership Programmes are being used as a platform to develop the Generous Spirit among our Mayflowerians. This is done by deepening the inculcation of the value of respect by **celebrating differences and contributing to society with empathy**.

Student Leadership programmes are divided into level-wide, school-wide and targeted student leadership training programmes. Level-wide Student Leadership programmes focus on developing the Mayflowerian’s team-building skills through programmes such as the Sec 1 Orientation and Sec 2 Cohort Camp. In the effort to strengthen their communication and collaboration skills when working in teams, the programme also focuses on equipping our students with 4 social skills:

*   Disagreeing Appropriately
*   Negotiating with Others
*   Offering Help
*   Organizing task and time

The school-wide leadership programmes – Student Council Presidential Election and Student Leaders Dialogue are also added platforms for Mayflowerians to put what they have learnt into practice at a higher level as the programmes also give them a glimpse of what is it like to be a Concerned, Informed and Participative member of the community.

To create a positive student learning experience, Mayflowerians are provided with 7 different choices of Student Leadership experience. Students have a say as to which Student Leadership group they would like to be part of, based on their interest and their preference of how they would like to contribute to the school community. Each group of student leaders has its own area to look into.

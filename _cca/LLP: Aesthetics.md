### Developing A Zest For Life Through Music, Performing And Visual Arts

We believe arts education is a powerful tool that helps students to become positive thinkers and spirited citizens. Positive thinking and perseverance are especially important during times of rapid change. As such, we design our aesthetics program to develop students' heads, hearts, and hands.

With a variety of platforms, students learn to be critical and creative thinkers. These skills are emphasized in three anchor curricula - Lower Secondary Music, Lower Secondary Arts and the Performing Arts CCA groups. When creating music, artworks or performances, students exercise creative and critical thinking skills. Students are encouraged to be curious, to think from diverse perspectives and to explore multiple possibilities to develop their creative capacity. Students are also guided to weigh critically which option would be the best. Through these platforms, students cultivate the habits of thinking creatively and critically. The ability to see different perspectives and think of alternatives helps a student become more positive and optimistic as they move through life.

To teach students to appreciate the arts is not an end in itself. One of its goals is also to help students see the beauty in their surroundings, leading to gratitude and joy in life. We also offer a stage for students to show off their talents and develop their self-confidence and self-esteem. For example - Interclass Dance Competition, Lunch Time Concerts, Mayflower Got Talent, Visual Art Exhibitions and external leadership camps and workshops. Another platform that encourages all students to participate in performing arts performances is our Biennial Aesthetics Production. To a greater extend, students apply their creative skills to design and implement their vision into reality on stage. Through this platform, many students have become more confident in public speaking and understand that deliberate effort leads to positive results. These students enjoy the experience of succeeding on stage.

At our school, the arts are not solely for personal interest and passion. The students are encouraged to think about how they can use their artistic talents to meet the needs of the wider community. By using the Design Thinking framework, students learn to create with empathy and to meet the authentic needs of their intended recipients.

In Mayflower Secondary School, we believe in providing a space for the arts because we know that arts education builds individuals with a zest for life.

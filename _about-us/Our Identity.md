### Our School Crest
![](/images/crest.svg)
The school crest is composed of the letters, MF, encompassed by the name of the school.

MF, the initials of the school, are depicted as a stalk of flower. The letter, M, is shaped artistically as a flower, while the letter, F, is designed as a stem with a blade of leaf on either side. This stalk of flower conveys the essence of message that "**Every Mayflowerian will bloom**".

While the artistic design accentuates the development of the individual on one level, it also emphasizes the pursuit of knowledge on another plane. The latter is represented by the torch of wisdom which is supported by an open book. The torch of wisdom which is supported by an open book. The stylised M in red can be viewed as the torch of wisdom, while the two blades of leaves are likened to an open book. The leaves in green are synonymous with the quest for knowledge, just as green leaves seek nutrients for growth.

The letter, M, is linked to the concept, "might" and from this the school motto, "**Mighty in Thought and Deed**" is derived. The simple and bold lettering of "Mayflower Secondary School" which is arranged in a circle, extols the attribute of "might" as the school unites in its effort to be strong and righteous in thoughts and action.The school crest is composed of the letters, MF, encompassed by the name of the school.

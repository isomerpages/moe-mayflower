### English Applied Learning Programme (ALP): Effective Communication

The ALP aims to address the increasing trend in the use of media as a platform of communication in the 21st century. Through the three-year progressive programmes, students will hone their speaking and writing skills via various platforms to be confident communicators. At Mayflower, Effective Communication (EC) focuses on equipping students with lifelong skills via language learning. As a school, we believe in providing a myriad of opportunities for all students to develop their communicative skills in everyday, real life situations. The EC provides plenty of authentic learning experiences for our students to enable them to acquire both creative and critical thinking skills. The English Department and the Mother Tongue are the main drivers of the EC organised level-wide programmes.

The EL department organises programmes such as Speech and Drama, Journalism and Broadcast, Debates and Public Presentations for all the levels both within their EL curriculum and beyond the curriculum as enrichment programmes. ALP experiences are anchored on EL learning outcomes and focus on the learning beyond that of the classroom. During the ALP sessions, students reflect upon the importance of voice, visualisation and perspectives in storytelling and news reporting, thereby becoming effective communicators. The sessions also provide students with hands-on experiences such as script writing, speech presentations and journalistic news reports. Students are also exposed to impromptu presentations and explored ‘unknown’ elements in real-life reporting and storytelling that required them to think on their feet and respond critically. On some occasions, there are also opportunities presented to EL ALP students to showcase their talent during assemblies and lunch time. Such presentations are usually received with much excitement and buzz by their peers. The EL ALP Tier 2 students are encouraged to participate in competitions beyond the school such as PESA, ACJC Debate Series and Toastmasters sessions. The learning in these workshops are undoubtedly very enriching and exciting for students.

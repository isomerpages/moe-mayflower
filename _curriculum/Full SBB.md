<p>Mayflower Secondary is one of the 28 secondary schools piloting aspects
of Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) since 2020.</p>
<h3>Purpose of Full SBB</h3>
<p>With Full SBB, we are moving towards one secondary education, with many
subject bands, to better meet our studentsâ€™ learning needs, without labels.
This is part of the broader shift in our education system to recognise
the strengths and interests of our children, to help them build their confidence
and develop an intrinsic motivation to learn for life in them.</p>

<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>There will no longer be Express, Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical)
streams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The students will take a set of subjects at a common level together for
lower secondary Art, Character &amp; Citizenship Education, Design &amp;
Technology, Food &amp; Consumer Education, Music, and Physical Education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For all other subjects, they will be grouped in classes according to the
level at which they offer each subject, i.e. G1, G2, G3 (G stands for General)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the end of secondary school, students will sit for the common national
examination and receive a new national certification with subjects at G1/G2/G3
levels. Students will use the new certification in the following year to
enter JC, Polytechnic or ITE in 2028.</p>
</li>
</ul>
